This project implements an autonomous navigation system using deep learning and computer vision techniques in Webots. It integrates:

- Behavioral cloning with a CNN model (based on Nvidia architecture)
- Lane detection using OpenCV (Canny + Hough transforms)
- Real-time object detection using YOLOv8
- Integration with SUMO to simulate urban traffic conditions

The repository includes:
- The full source code for training, evaluation, and simulation control
- A demonstration video showing the autonomous driving behavior in Webots
- Documentation and setup instructions for reproducing the experiment

## ðŸ”§ Technologies
